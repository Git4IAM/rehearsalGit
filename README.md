Timber joints used in traditional Japanese constructions have no metal plates or fasteners. Because these joints resist external force by embedment to each member, they show high ductility. The ductile joints get much attention recently. Japanese “Watari-ago” joint used in horizontal structure is one such ductile joint. The joint consists of two beams with interlocking notches, which build resistance against in-plane shear forces. In this paper, the mechanical behavior of “Watari-ago” joints is studied experimentally and theoretically. Experimental results show that “Watari-ago” joints can retain resistance after reaching their yield strength and that mechanical behavior varies depending upon notch shape and size. In theoretical research, a predicting model of mechanical behavior of the joint is developed by applying wooden embedment theory. The model proposed in this study also identifies the size that gives optimal mechanical performance. By numerical calculation on the basis of the model, the authors find it quantitatively that the increase of the sizes of beam width and notch depth has greatly effect on the moment resistance.
